      Hello!

      It's me, the helpful Ranger bot ðŸ¤ 

      It appears that this proposal is a duplicate of an existing proposal. If this is indeed the case, this will be closed within $DELAY.

      If not -- please remove the label `bot: duplicate` and I'll leave this open.

      Hello!

      It's me, the helpful Ranger bot ðŸ¤ 

      I noticed that the label `status: needs official review` has been applied. This means that this request is currently waiting for a review from the @gatsbyjs/core team to review this proposal.

      As soon as a member of the team is able, they'll swoop in and help progress this further.

      Hello!

      I noticed that the label `status: needs response` has been applied. This means that I'm currently waiting for something _from you_ to help @gatsbyjs/core progress this further.

      If the label `status: needs response` still exists after $DELAY, this will be automatically closed. However, you can always re-open and pick back up right where you left off!

      Hello!

      Sorry to hear that you're running into an issue. To help us best begin debugging the underlying cause, it is incredibly helpful if you're able to [create a minimal reproduction](https://gatsby.dev/reproduction). This is a simplified example of the issue that makes it clear and obvious what the issue is and how we can begin to debug it.

      _Note: if a reproduction has not been supplied in $DELAY, this issue will be closed by me, your helpful Ranger bot ðŸ¤ ._

      Once you've supplied a reproduction remove the `status: needs reproduction` label, and this issue will remain open and we can take a closer look!

      Thanks for using Gatsby! ðŸ’œ
