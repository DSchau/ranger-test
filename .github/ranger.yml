Hello!

Sorry to hear that you're running into an issue. To help us best begin debugging the underlying cause, it is incredibly helpful if you're able to create a minimal reproduction. This is a simplified example of the issue that makes it clear and obvious what the issue is and how we can begin to debug it.

If you're up for it, we'd very much appreciate if you could provide a [minimal reproduction](https://gatsby.dev/reproduction) and we'll be able to take another look.

Note: if a reproduction has not been supplied in 7 days, this issue will be closed by your friendly Ranger bot ðŸ¤–.

Once you've supplied a reproduction remove the `status: needs reproduction` label, and this issue will remain open!

Thanks for using Gatsby! ðŸ’œ
