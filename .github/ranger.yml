      Hello!

      Sorry to hear that you're running into an issue. To help us best begin debugging the underlying cause, it is incredibly helpful if you're able to [create a minimal reproduction](https://gatsby.dev/reproduction). This is a simplified example of the issue that makes it clear and obvious what the issue is and how we can begin to debug it.

      _Note: if a reproduction has not been supplied in 7 days, this issue will be closed by me, Ranger bot ðŸ¤ ðŸ¤–._

      Once you've supplied a reproduction remove the `status: needs reproduction` label, and this issue will remain open and we can take a closer look!

      Thanks for using Gatsby! ðŸ’œ
